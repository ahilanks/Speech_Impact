# Audio File Requirements

To make the Speech Impact Visualizer work properly, you need to add an audio file:

1. Place your speech audio file in this directory (the `public` folder)
2. Name the file **exactly** `speech.mp3` 
3. Make sure it's an MP3 format file

## No Audio File?

If you don't have the actual speech audio file, the visualization will still work, but the audio playback features won't function. The application will show a warning message explaining the issue.

## Audio File Format

The best results are achieved with an MP3 file that:
- Has clear audio quality
- Matches the timing in the transcription data
- Includes audience reactions (clapping)
